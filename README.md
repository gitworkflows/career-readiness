There are so many things we don’t control during our job search process, but some are under our control, and here’s where we will start. 

###  1️⃣ Check your skills

For this part, you will need to write down each project you have worked on. It can be a Hackathon project, and you will need to write the following information for each. 

 - [ ] The technologies we used,  
 - [ ] what we learned,  
 - [ ] what we would do differently,  
 - [ ] will we do it again?

###  2️⃣ What roles are we aiming to achieve

To achieve career success, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of the roles you want to pursue. One way to identify potential roles is by browsing job descriptions on LinkedIn or other job portals. This allows you to gain insight into the types of roles available and the skills and qualifications required. Creating a list of job titles that interest you is a good starting point, 

Your homework is to create a list of jobs that caught your eye and look for patterns. For each job post, you will need this info:

 - [ ] Skills needed
 - [ ] Skills desired  
 - [ ] Responsibilities 
 
 ###  3️⃣ What we have and what we’re missing 
 
You will identify the skills you already have and which ones you need to learn.

Review the job descriptions, and from the list of our skills, we will identify if we have the skill, if we need to learn it, or if we already have it. 

You can use [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) and [Educative](https://www.educative.io/) for the skills you need to learn, which are included in the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). 

This is the first week of the Career Readiness experience. Next week we will focus on CV, LinkedIn, and our GitHub profile.
